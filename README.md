# qo

## Installation (not the final instructions but fast setup for testing only)

If you use `ssh`

```
git clone git@github.com:ahmedYasserM/qo.git
```

or if you don't clone it the way you are used to.

you will need `go` installed

```
sudo pacman -S go
```

```bash
cd qo
```

```bash
go install
```

This will install binary called `qo` into the `GOBIN` directory, so if itsn't in your path please add it.
